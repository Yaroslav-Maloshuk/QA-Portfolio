- **Link:** https://github.com/soapyigu/Swift-30-Projects
- **Type:** Functional Mobile App (iOS - Swift)
- **Goal:** Verify app functionality, UI responsiveness, and navigation flow; identify and document defects across devices.
- **Scope:** The testing scope focused on functional validation of the FacebookMe module within the Swift-30-Projects iOS app collection. The objective was to ensure correct navigation and responsiveness of the app’s interactive elements, including Profile, Friends, Events, Settings, and Help sections. Tests covered button responsiveness, navigation accuracy, UI element interaction, and error handling across different iOS versions and screen resolutions.

- **Tools Used:** XCode, Excel for test-cases & bug reports.
- **What I did:**  
  - Created and executed manual test cases for all major UI and navigation components.
  - Verified the functionality of buttons such as View Profile, Friends, Events, Settings, and Log Out.
  -	Tested user flows and interactions on multiple iOS devices and OS versions.
  - Reported and tracked critical bugs with clear reproduction steps, expected vs. actual results, and linked evidence.
  - Captured screenshots and maintained detailed documentation for issue traceability.
- **Key Achievements:**
  - Identified 12 critical UI defects affecting navigation and user interaction.
  - Verified that none of the key navigation buttons performed their intended redirections, providing actionable data for developers.
  - Enhanced bug reporting structure by including precise reproduction steps and GitHub references.
  - Confirmed consistent reproduction of UI issues across devices, improving cross-platform reliability insights.
  - Delivered comprehensive test evidence that strengthened project documentation and regression planning.
