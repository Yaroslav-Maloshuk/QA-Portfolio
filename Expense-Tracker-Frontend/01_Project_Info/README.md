- **Folder:** `Expense-Tracker-Frontend`
- **Link:** https://github.com/sajaiprathap61/Expense-Tracker-Frontend
- **Type:** Functional Mobile App (Android - Kotlin)
- **Goal:** Verify app functionality and report bugs.
- **Scope:** The testing scope focused on validating the core UI and functional behavior of the Expense Tracker app, including the Today, Month, and Year filtering buttons, as well as expense list interactions (e.g., opening details or receipts).
Testing aimed to ensure that all interactive UI elements were responsive and correctly linked to their corresponding logic for filtering, viewing, or editing expense data.
Cross-device testing was conducted to check compatibility across multiple Android versions and screen resolutions, with emphasis on ensuring smooth interaction, proper event handling, and absence of unresponsive UI elements.
- **Devices Tested:** Pixel 2 (Android 8.1), Pixel 4a (Android 11), Pixel 6 (Android 13), Pixel 8 Pro (Android 14), Pixel 9 Pro (Android 15), Pixel 9 Pro XL (Android 16), Pixel Fold (Android 14)
- **Tools Used:** Android Studio, Excel for test-cases & bug reports.
- **What I did:**  
  - Designed and executed manual test cases covering UI interactions and filtering functionality.
  - Verified button responsiveness and expense item click actions across various devices.
  - Identified unresponsive UI elements and documented steps for reproduction with screenshots.
  - Reported issues with detailed logs, expected/actual results, and GitHub reference links.
  - Conducted compatibility and regression testing across multiple Android OS versions.
- **Key Achievements:**
  - Detected a critical UI defect where primary navigation buttons (Today, Month, Year) and expense list items were entirely non-clickable.
  - Validated backend filtering logic triggers, confirming missing linkage between UI events and functional calls.
  - Ensured cross-version stability testing on Android 8.1–16 devices.
  - Created comprehensive test documentation and structured bug reports improving developer debugging efficiency.
  - Contributed to UI responsiveness and event-handling improvements in subsequent builds.
