- **Folder:** `Project 02 - Stopwatch`
- **Link:** https://github.com/soapyigu/Swift-30-Projects
- **Type:** Functional Mobile App (iOS - Swift)
- **Goal:** Verify stopwatch functionality and confirm reliable performance across devices.
- **Scope:** The testing scope included functional validation and reliability testing of the Stopwatch module within the Swift-30-Projects iOS collection. The objective was to ensure correct behavior of all core stopwatch actions — Start, Stop, Lap, and Reset — under both standard and repeated usage scenarios. Testing also focused on verifying UI responsiveness, time tracking accuracy, and lap recording consistency across different iOS versions and screen sizes. Both normal operation and edge cases (e.g., multiple start/stop cycles, lap resets) were validated through detailed manual test cases.
- **Devices Tested:** iPhone SE (2nd gen) (iOS 16.0), iPhone 13 (iOS 16.0), iPhone 15 Pro (iOS 17.0), iPhone 16 Pro Max (iOS 18.0), iPad Pro (iOS 17.0)
- **Tools Used:** XCode, Excel for test-cases & bug reports.
- **What I did:**  
  - Developed and executed comprehensive manual test cases covering all stopwatch features.
  - Verified core functions: Start, Stop, Lap, and Reset.
  - Tested multiple operation cycles to confirm consistent time tracking and data resets.
  - Validated lap recording accuracy and UI synchronization.
  - Ensured cross-device stability and layout consistency on iPhone and iPad.
  - Documented detailed steps, expected vs. actual results, and attached GitHub references.
- **Key Achievements:**
  - Achieved 100% functional test coverage across stopwatch core features.
  - Confirmed accurate lap timing and reset behavior across all tested devices.
  - Validated stable multi-cycle performance with no timer drift or UI lag.
  - Identified and verified proper data reset behavior after consecutive operations.
  - Ensured full functionality under iOS versions 16–18 and multiple form factors.
  - Delivered structured documentation that strengthened regression testing confidence.
