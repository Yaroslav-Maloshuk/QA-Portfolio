- **Folder:** `samples-android-todo-kotlin-and-compose`
- **Link:** ...
- **Type:** Functional Mobile App (Android - Kotlin)
- **Goal:** Verify app functionality and report bugs.
- **Scope:** The testing scope covered full functional validation of the samples-android-todo-kotlin-and-compose mobile app to ensure correct behavior of task management features across multiple Android versions and form factors. The primary focus was on verifying task lifecycle operations — adding, marking as done, and deleting tasks — as well as assessing UI responsiveness, state persistence, and user feedback mechanisms (toasts/popups). Testing included regression checks, validation of expected vs. actual UI messages, and documentation of discovered issues through detailed test cases and screenshots.
- **Devices Tested:** Pixel 2 (Android 8.1), Pixel 4a (Android 11), Pixel 6 (Android 13), Pixel 8 Pro (Android 14), Pixel 9 Pro (Android 15), Pixel 9 Pro XL (Android 16), Pixel Fold (Android 14)
- **Tools Used:** Android Studio, Excel for test-cases & bug reports.
- **What I did:**  
  - Created and executed manual test cases.
  - Reported and tracked bugs with detailed reproduction steps.
  - Tested across multiple devices and operating systems.
  - Collected screenshots for documentation.
- **Key Achievements:**
  -	Designed and executed a comprehensive manual test suite covering all core app functionalities.
  -	Identified and documented UI message handling bugs (e.g., missing deletion confirmation popups).
  -	Validated functional consistency across 7 Pixel devices running Android versions 8.1 to 16, ensuring backward and forward compatibility.
  -	Created a structured Excel-based test matrix linking each case to environment, steps, expected and actual results, and GitHub reference URLs.
  -	Delivered clear bug reproduction reports with screenshots, supporting streamlined developer debugging.
  - Ensured full coverage of CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and cross-tab task synchronization (“Not Done Yet” ↔ “Done”).
  - Contributed to improving app stability and UX consistency by providing actionable QA insights.
