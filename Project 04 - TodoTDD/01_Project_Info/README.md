- **Folder:** `Project 04 - TodoTDD`
- **Link:** https://github.com/soapyigu/Swift-30-Projects
- **Type:** Functional Mobile App (iOS - Swift)
- **Goal:** Verify app functionality and report bugs.
- **Scope:** The testing scope covered core task management operations—creating, editing, and deleting tasks—within the TodoTDD iOS app. The focus was on validating data persistence, UI responsiveness, and real-time updates to the task list after user actions.
Testing included positive and negative test scenarios for all CRUD operations and was executed across multiple iPhone and iPad models running iOS 16 – 26. Emphasis was placed on verifying app behavior consistency, particularly data visibility after task creation, and ensuring reliability across device reboots and relaunches.
- **Devices Tested:** iPhone SE (2nd gen) (iOS 16.0), iPhone 13 (iOS 16.0), iPhone 15 Pro (iOS 17.0), iPhone 16 Pro Max (iOS 18.0), iPhone 17 (iOS 26.0), iPhone 17 Pro (iOS 26.0), iPhone 17 Pro Max (iOS 18.0), iPad (10th gen) (iOS 17.0), iPad Pro M4 (iOS 18.0)
- **Tools Used:** XCode, Excel for test-cases & bug reports.
- **What I did:**  
  - Designed and executed manual test cases for adding, editing, and deleting tasks.
  - Conducted cross-device validation to ensure consistent behavior across different iOS versions.
  - Reported critical bugs related to task list updates and data refresh behavior.
  - Logged defects with detailed reproduction steps, expected vs. actual results, and evidence links.
  - Captured screenshots and documented test outcomes in structured Excel reports.
- **Key Achievements:**
  - Identified high-priority bugs affecting task persistence and UI refresh after creation.
  - Detected failures in edit and delete functions, enabling developers to address major logic flaws.
  - Validated partial data persistence (tasks appear only after app restart), providing insights into state management issues.
  - Ensured complete coverage of CRUD operations and regression-tested fixes post-deployment.
  - Delivered comprehensive test documentation improving traceability and future release validation.
