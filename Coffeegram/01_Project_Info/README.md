- **Folder:** `Coffeegram`
- **Link:** https://github.com/phansier/Coffeegram
- **Type:** Functional Mobile App (Android - Kotlin)
- **Goal:** Verify app functionality and report bugs.
- **Scope:** The testing scope focused on validating the core drink-tracking logic, calendar functionality, and UI customization settings of the Coffeegram mobile app. Testing covered the entire workflow of adding, removing, and modifying drink entries across past, present, and future dates, ensuring data integrity and logical constraints (e.g., preventing edits on past dates). The Settings module was also tested to confirm theme-switching behavior (System, Light, Dark, Cupertino, Summer, Dynamic) and device compatibility with Android Material and Cupertino styles. Manual testing was executed on multiple Android devices and OS versions to ensure functional consistency and visual accuracy.
- **Devices Tested:** Pixel 2 (Android 8.1), Pixel 4a (Android 11), Pixel 6 (Android 13), Pixel 8 Pro (Android 14), Pixel 9 Pro (Android 15), Pixel 9 Pro XL (Android 16), Pixel Fold (Android 14)
- **Tools Used:** Android Studio, Excel for test-cases & bug reports.
- **What I did:**  
  - Designed and executed detailed manual test cases for drink-tracking, calendar logic, and theme settings.
  - Verified CRUD actions (add/remove) for drinks across different dates and validated system constraints.
  - Documented all test scenarios, including edge cases such as bulk additions/removals and invalid dates.
  - Identified functional bugs and design inconsistencies, providing detailed reproduction steps and screenshots.
  - Validated UI theme application across devices, detecting failures in “Summer” and “Dynamic” styles.
  - Compiled all findings into structured Excel test matrices for developer reference.
- **Key Achievements:**
  - Uncovered major logic defects allowing drink modifications on past dates that should have been locked.
  - Validated correct app behavior for present and future dates, confirming stability of normal workflows.
  - Discovered UI inconsistencies in theme switching (“Summer” and “Dynamic” modes not applying correctly).
  - Ensured functional coverage across 7 Android devices (Android 8.1 – 16) with different screen formats.
  - Delivered comprehensive bug documentation with clear reproduction steps, environment details, and attachments.
  - Contributed to improving data validation and UI consistency, enhancing overall user experience.
